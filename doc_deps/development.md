# ColrC Development

If you are looking to send a pull request, or compile the `colrc` tool yourself,
there are a few things you might need to know. These subpages contain information
about compiling, testing, system dependencies, and anything else relevant to
working on **ColrC** itself.

They are not required reading for a user of colr.h and colr.c.

- \subpage tests "Testing": How ColrC is tested.
