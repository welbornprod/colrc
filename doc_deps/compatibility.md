# Compatibility {#compatibility}
# About

ColrC was written with Linux in mind, specifically Debian-based distributions.
If it works on any other system, it is purely by accident and I would like to
hear what you're running it on.

# Porting
If ColrC needs a litle tweak here or there to make it work on your system,
please create an issue or a pull-request to let me know. It would be great for
ColrC to work on as many machines as possible, but I don't have the resources
to test against them all.


# Windows
Work may be done in the future to make ColrC run on Windows 10+ machines
(like Colr.py), but as of right now it is not possible. Again, if you would
like to see that happen please create an issue or a pull-request.
